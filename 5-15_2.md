Week 9/27 and 10/4
Over the last two weeks Iâ€™ve worked on a basic program to use RTOS on the nucleo board. I managed to write a simple program to test the RTOS software which lets two LED blinc in a different frequency without adding much delay to the main loop. I saved the test program on our github server so that everybody has access to it. I also continued to work on the Polulo Maestro Servo Controller. Last Saturday I wrote the code to control up to six servos via a serial connection from the nucleo board. I also documented the data on our discord channel and saved the code on github.
